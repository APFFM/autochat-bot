SARS CoV 2 Most cases over the course of the pandemic have been in Ontario Quebec British Columbia and Alberta Confirmed cases have been reported in all of Canada s provinces and territories The virus was confirmed to have reached Canada on January 25 2020 after an individual who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan Hubei China tested positive The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on March 5 In March 2020 as cases of community transmission were confirmed all of Canada s provinces and territories declared states of emergency Provinces and territories have to varying degrees implemented school and daycare closures prohibitions on gatherings closures of non essential businesses and restrictions on entry Canada severely restricted its border access barring travelers from all countries with some exceptions The federal Minister of Health invoked the Quarantine Act introduced following the 2002 2004 SARS outbreak For the first time in its legislative history the act has been used legally requiring all travelers excluding essential workers returning to the country to self isolate for 14 days until rules were changed to accommodate fully vaccinated travelers By mid to late summer of 2020 the country saw a steady decline in active cases until the beginning of late summer Through autumn there was a resurgence of cases in all provinces and territories On September 23 2020 Prime Minister Trudeau declared that Canada was experiencing a second wave of the virus New restrictions from provincial governments were put in place once again as cases increased including variations of regional lockdowns In late November there was the disbandment of the Atlantic Bubble a travel restricted area of the country formed of the four Atlantic provinces New Brunswick Prince Edward Island Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador which had been established in July 2020 The federal government passed legislation to approve further modified economic aid for businesses and individuals Nation wide cases hospitalizations and deaths spiked preceding and following the Christmas and holiday season in December 2020 and January 2021 Alarmed by hospital capacity issues fatalities and new cases heavy restrictions such as lockdowns and curfews were put in place in affected areas primarily Ontario Quebec and Alberta and across the country These lockdowns caused active cases to steadily decline reaching a plateau in active cases in mid February 2021 During a third wave of the virus cases began rising across most provinces west of Atlantic Canada in mid March prompting further lockdowns and restrictions in the most populous provinces like Ontario and Quebec Due to a relatively low volume of cases in the Atlantic provinces the travel restricted Atlantic Bubble was planned to reopen however in late April the third wave had spread to the Atlantic provinces In response Newfoundland and Labrador Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia reinstated travel bans toward the rest of the country Following Health Canada s approval of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID 19 vaccine and later the mRNA 1273 vaccine developed by Moderna mass vaccinations began nationwide on December 14 2020 On February 26 2021 Health Canada approved the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID 19 vaccine for use and on March 5 2021 they additionally approved the Janssen COVID 19 vaccine for a total of four approved vaccines in the nation However most provinces discontinued first doses of Oxford AstraZeneca by May 12 2021 while the administration of the Janssen vaccine was determined unnecessary Canada became one of the most vaccinated countries in the world with a continually high uptake of the vaccine Despite high general uptake of the vaccine cases began to surge particularly amongst the unvaccinated population in provinces like Alberta which had removed nearly all pandemic restrictions Near the end of summer 2021 cases began to surge across Canada notably in the provinces of British Columbia Alberta Quebec and Ontario particularly amongst the unvaccinated population During this fourth wave of the virus return to pandemic restrictions such as mask mandates were reinstated in provinces like British Columbia and Alberta The surge in cases was largely deemed to be a pandemic of the unvaccinated and resulted in the introduction of vaccine passports for all provinces and two of the territories Federally Prime Minister Justin Trudeau instated requirements for vaccination in order to partake in air travel as well as those who ride Via Rail and Rocky Mountaineer trains as of October 30 2021 Additionally the mandate included any federally regulated workers In January 2022 all of Canada s provinces and territories were experiencing record level case numbers primarily driven by the SARS CoV 2 Omicron variant which caused provincial and territorial governments to reintroduce restrictions surrounding travel and isolation However in mid February active caseloads and hospitalizations began to decrease and towards the end of February 2022 almost all provinces and territories had announced plans to lift restrictions by early March or mid March 2022 if epidemiology remained favorable',\n",

CoV 2 As of 10 February 2023 with over 5 million confirmed COVID 19 cases a high of approximately 323 000 active cases nearly 40 000 deaths and over 66 million tests the country is currently ranked third in the number of COVID 19 cases in Southeast Asia behind Vietnam and Indonesia and fourth in the number of COVID 19 deaths in Southeast Asia behind Indonesia the Philippines and Vietnam Since January 2020 the medical response and preparedness for the outbreak in Malaysia are overseen by the Director General of Health Noor Hisham Abdullah under the Health Ministry of four successive governments led by the Mahathir Muhyiddin Ismail Sabri and Anwar Ibrahim cabinets The first cases in Malaysia were confirmed among travellers from China in Johor via Singapore on 25 January 2020 and continued to be limited to a few imported cases until March 2020 when several local clusters emerged The most notable was a Tablighi Jamaat religious gathering in Sri Petaling Kuala Lumpur that sparked a massive spike in local cases and imported cases to neighbouring countries By the end of March the total number of cases had risen from below 30 to over 2 000 active cases across every state and federal territory in the country In response to the surge of cases in March 2020 the Malaysian government led by Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin imposed a nationwide lockdown known as the Movement Control Order MCO which came into effect on 18 March 2020 The MCO which was supposed to be ended on 31 March 2020 was extended to early May 2020 By early May the MCO had led to a gradual decline in daily infections The government progressively relaxed lockdown restrictions in a staggered phase beginning with the Conditional Movement Control Order CMCO on 4 May 2020 which allows most business sectors to be reopened under strict standard operating procedures SOPs followed by the Recovery Movement Control Order RMCO on 10 June 2020 The government had planned to end the RMCO on 31 August 2020 but due to the continuous detection of imported cases measures were extended until the end of the year with several sectors remaining closed and strict travel restrictions from several countries remaining in place The third wave of COVID 19 infections in the country occurred as a result of the Sabah state election in September 2020 and several outbreaks at Top Glove facilities in late 2020 The Malaysian government responded by restoring CMCO restrictions in most states since November 2020 to counter the outbreak By mid January 2021 the pressure of COVID 19 on the country s healthcare system led to the reintroduction of MCO restrictions across various Malaysian states and federal territories which was extended to March 4 2021 A nationwide state of emergency was also declared on 12 January 2021 by the Yang di Pertuan Agong suspending Parliament and State Legislative assemblies and granting the Muhyiddin government emergency powers until 1 August 2021 Due to a decline in new cases by early March 2021 the government lifted MCO restrictions in all states and federal territories However the restrictions were reinstated in several states in mid April as infection cases rose again With novel SARS CoV 2 variants detected in Malaysia and a record surge in daily COVID 19 cases and deaths the government reintroduced a nationwide MCO once more from May 12 2021 The MCO was strengthened into a total lockdown from June 1 that was extended indefinitely as the severe and continued spread of the Delta variant led to Malaysia s healthcare system capacity being reached in some regions Following high vaccination rates in the adult population against COVID 19 and a decrease in the number of severe cases of the disease since September 2021 Malaysia announced its intention to transition to treating COVID 19 as an endemic disease by the end of October 2021 with more generalised restrictions being eased A fifth wave fueled by the Omicron variant led to record daily cases in February and March 2022 but was marked by lower numbers of hospitalizations and deaths than during the spread of the Delta variant As of March 2022 the BA 2 Omicron subvariant was projected to be the dominant strain in the country The pandemic has had a severe economic impact devaluing Malaysia s currency and shrinking its GDP and has had far reaching effects on Malaysian society The onset of the pandemic in early 2020 coincided with an initially unrelated political crisis that hampered the government s early response and the repeated COVID 19 waves and emergency measures exacerbated ongoing political instability throughout 2020 and 2021 This led to Muhyiddin s resignation following the collapse of his government and the appointment of a successor government under Ismail Sabri Yaakob in August 2021 The country s vaccination programme which commenced in late February 2021 has fully inoculated over 80 of the population and 97 of adults as of 24 April 2022',\n",

Thailand was the first country to report a case outside China on 13 January 2020 As of 2 April 2022 the country has reported a cumulative total of 3 684 755 confirmed cases with 25 318 deaths from the disease and currently ranked fourth in the number of cases in Southeast Asia behind Vietnam Indonesia and Malaysia Thailand was relatively successful in containing the pandemic throughout most of 2020 but has been experiencing an uncontrolled resurgent outbreak since April 2021 An initial wave of infections mostly traced to nightlife venues and a boxing match in Bangkok peaked on 22 March 2020 at 188 newly confirmed cases per day As preventive measures were implemented the outbreak subsided by May and the country reported almost no locally transmitted infections until December when it saw a surge of infections primarily clustered around large migrant worker communities in Samut Sakhon Province The new outbreak spread to many provinces with a maximum daily of 959 cases reported on 26 January 2021 before partially subsiding in February In April however a new wave of infections originated from Bangkok s Thong Lo area nightlife venues and rapidly spread in Bangkok as well as throughout the country It was identified to be of the highly transmissible Alpha variant first reported from the United Kingdom and by 14 April over a thousand cases per day were being identified causing a shortage of hospital beds as government policy required admission of all confirmed cases The Thai government s response to the outbreak was initially based on surveillance and contact tracing though it was late to implement clear quarantine measures In response to the first outbreak Prime Minister Prayut Chan o cha declared a state of emergency effective on 26 March and the Centre for COVID 19 Situation Administration CCSA was established to coordinate the government s response working in conjunction with the Department of Disease Control and issuing public communications through its spokesperson Taweesin Visanuyothin Lockdown measures were implemented in varying degrees throughout the country with public venues and businesses ordered to close A curfew went into effect on 3 April and all commercial international flights were suspended from 4 April The public has cooperated relatively well with health advisories and the country s robust public health infrastructure has been credited as a contributing factor to its relatively successful initial response Easing of restrictions was gradually implemented from mid May The curfew was lifted in July and academia reopened in August However the state of emergency remained in effect With the subsequent outbreaks in December 2020 and April 2021 the government appeared reluctant to implement the same degree of restrictive measures for fear of further disruptions to the economy In December it focused instead on mass testing of migrant workers and travel restrictions from affected provinces while in April it allowed the Songkran Thai New Year holidays to go ahead though without water splashing celebrations despite having cancelled the holidays in 2020 when the caseload was lower Vaccinations began at the end of February 2021 mostly limited to healthcare workers and mainly using the CoronaVac vaccine imported from China s Sinovac Biotech The majority of the country s vaccine supply is planned to rely heavily on the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine through a manufacturing deal secured by palace owned Siam Bioscience company with first batches expected in June 2021 The pandemic has heavily disrupted the country s economy of which tourism is a significant sector The International Monetary Fund has predicted Thailand s GDP to shrink by 6 7 percent in 2020 a revision from a previous estimated 2 5 increase The government has borrowed and announced several assistance measures including cash handouts to those affected and a 1 9 trillion baht US 60 billion stimulus package though few people have actually received it Dissatisfaction to its economic impact and government response contributed to the second wave of 2020 2021 Thai protests starting from 18 July 2020 On 23 September 2022 General Prawit Wongsuwan Deputy Prime Minister acting Prime Minister chair of CCSA was reported that General Supot Malaniyom Secretary General of the National Security Council NSC had reported a better overview of the pandemic new infected and the death toll decreased and the Ministry of Public Health has adjusted the COVID 19 from dangerous communicable diseases to surveillance infectious disease therefore resolved to cancel the declared a state of emergency and collapse the Centre for COVID 19 Situation Administration CCSA with effect from 30 September 2022 onwards and will use the Communicable Diseases Act B E 2558 which was already approved by the Cabinet in 2021 to control the COVID 19 situation instead',\n",

       "  'summary': 'The transmission of COVID 19 is the passing of coronavirus disease 2019 from person to person COVID 19 is mainly transmitted when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets aerosols and small airborne particles containing the virus Infected people exhale those particles as they breathe talk cough sneeze or sing Transmission is more likely the closer people are However infection can occur over longer distances particularly indoors The transmission of the virus is carried out through virus laden fluid particles or droplets which are created in the respiratory tract and they are expelled by the mouth and the nose There are three types of transmission droplet and contact which are associated with large droplets and airborne which is associated with small droplets If the droplets are above a certain critical size they settle faster than they evaporate and therefore they contaminate surfaces surrounding them Droplets that are below a certain critical size evaporate faster than they settle due to that fact they form nuclei that remain airborne for a long period of time over extensive distances Infectivity can begin four to five days before the onset of symptoms Infected people can spread the disease even if they are pre symptomatic or asymptomatic Most commonly the peak viral load in upper respiratory tract samples occurs close to the time of symptom onset and declines after the first week after symptoms begin Current evidence suggests a duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness of up to ten days following symptom onset for people with mild to moderate COVID 19 and up to 20 days for persons with severe COVID 19 including immunocompromised people Infectious particles range in size from aerosols that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time to larger droplets that remain airborne briefly or fall to the ground Additionally COVID 19 research has redefined the traditional understanding of how respiratory viruses are transmitted The largest droplets of respiratory fluid do not travel far but can be inhaled or land on mucous membranes on the eyes nose or mouth to infect Aerosols are highest in concentration when people are in close proximity which leads to easier viral transmission when people are physically close but airborne transmission can occur at longer distances mainly in locations that are poorly ventilated in those conditions small particles can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours The number of people generally infected by one infected person varies but it is estimated that the R0 R nought or R zero number is around 2 5 The disease often spreads in clusters where infections can be traced back to an index case or geographical location Often in these instances superspreading events occur where many people are infected by one person A person can get COVID 19 indirectly by touching a contaminated surface or object before touching their own mouth nose or eyes though strong evidence suggests this does not contribute substantially to new infections Transmission from human to animal is possible as in the first case but the probability of a human contracting the disease from an animal is considered very low Although it is considered possible there is no direct evidence of the virus being transmitted by skin to skin contact Transmission through feces and wastewater have also been identified as possible The virus is not known to spread through urine breast milk food or drinking water It very rarely transmits from mother to baby during pregnancy',\n",

Bavaria By mid February the arising cluster of cases had been fully contained On 25 and 26 February multiple cases related to the Italian outbreak were detected in Baden W rttemberg A carnival event on 15 February in Heinsberg North Rhine Westphalia was attended by a man identified as positive on 25 February in the outbreak which subsequently developed from infected participants authorities were mostly no longer able to trace the likely chains of infections On 9 March the first two deaths in Germany were reported from Essen and Heinsberg New clusters were introduced in other regions via Heinsberg as well as via people arriving from China Iran and Italy from where non Germans could arrive by plane until 17 18 March From 13 March German states mandated school and kindergarten closures postponed academic semesters and prohibited visits to nursing homes to protect the elderly Two days later borders to Austria Denmark France Luxembourg and Switzerland were closed By 22 March curfews were imposed in six German states while other states prohibited physical contact with more than one person from outside one s household On 15 April 2020 Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke of fragile intermediate success that had been achieved in the fight against the pandemic The same day a first loosening of restrictions was announced continued in early May and eventually holiday travels were allowed in cooperation with other European countries A number of state premiers pressed for faster relaxation of restrictions putting them at odds with Merkel who favoured a more cautious approach a pattern that repeated itself later that year Substantial local outbreaks in meat processing plants drew public attention beyond the epidemiological context to poor working conditions By late August infection numbers had returned to the levels of April and a possible second wave of the pandemic was under debate By mid October it was believed by experts to be inevitable A partial lockdown from 2 November only temporarily halted the rise in case numbers the total number of reported infections since the start of the pandemic crossed one million on 27 November A hard lockdown from 15 December made FFP2 masks or other clinical masks mandatory on public transport and in shops Repeated lockdown extensions were mainly motivated by the appearance of the Alpha variant and other mutations Death rates in nursing homes remained high until late January 2021 but dropped strongly in February likely due to residents and workers at these facilities having been prioritised in the vaccination campaign The second wave peaked in January In March 2021 the Alpha variant drove a third wave of infections The average age of the infected as well as of those requiring intensive care was much younger than in the first two waves A reform of the Infection Protection Act in late April increased federal government powers allowing it to mandate pandemic measures in hard hit districts in November 2021 the measures were ruled by the Federal Constitutional Court to have been legal From late April infection numbers started to continuously decrease the third wave was seen as broken by early May The Delta variant became dominant among the new infections by the end of June and from early July cases started to increase again On 20 August the RKI assessed the country to have entered the fourth wave of the pandemic again with most of the cases coming from the younger age groups With effect from 23 August the so called 3G rule gave those who were vaccinated had recovered or had a negative test result no older than 24 hours more freedom to visit numerous venues From mid October infections and intensive care unit admissions started to increase again On 4 November as almost 34 000 reported infections set a new record since the beginning of the pandemic Health Minister Jens Spahn spoke of a massive pandemic of the unvaccinated which was criticized by scientists for underrating the role of the vaccinated in the pandemic Unprecedentedly high infection numbers led Germany to reintroduce free coronavirus testing in November a month after they had been phased out and to launch a booster campaign Booster vaccinations were declared by new Health Minister Karl Lauterbach to be central to the government strategy of combating the Omicron variant Warnings of a massive fifth wave driven by Omicron in December proved to be no exaggeration as daily case numbers rose up to over 200 000 by mid February 2022 and remained at a high level in March Experts considered the absence of a decrease to be due to the BA 2 subvariant of Omicron which had ushered in the sixth wave of the pandemic and expected more cases after the easing of pandemic measures scheduled to begin on 21 March Vaccinations with the Pfizer BioNTech COVID 19 vaccine began on 27 December 2020 unofficially one day earlier vaccinations with the Moderna COVID 19 vaccine the AstraZeneca vaccine and the Janssen COVID 19 vaccine began in mid January early February and mid March 2021 respectively Vaccinations with AstraZeneca were stalled on 16 March 2021 due to concerns about rare and potentially lethal side effects but resumed on 19 March after the European Medicines Agency deemed the vaccine safe and effective On 30 March German vaccination commission STIKO recommended limiting the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to those aged 60 or over but revised this on 22 April to allow for use in younger ages subject to their consent to medical advice about the risks Vaccinations accelerated in April with a total of 15 million shots given that month On 6 May the AstraZeneca vaccine was made available to all adults with the Johnson Johnson vaccine following on 10 May and all others on 7 June Vaccination with AstraZeneca ceased on 1 December 2021 On 3 February 2022 the Novavax COVID 19 vaccine was approved As of 25 November 2021 68 1 per cent of the total population had completed their

       "  'summary': 'In mathematical modeling overfitting is the production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data and may therefore fail to fit to additional data or predict future observations reliably An overfitted model is a mathematical model that contains more parameters than can be justified by the data In a mathematical sense these parameters represent the degree of a polynomial The essence of overfitting is to have unknowingly extracted some of the residual variation i e the noise as if that variation represented underlying model structure 45 Underfitting occurs when a mathematical model cannot adequately capture the underlying structure of the data An under fitted model is a model where some parameters or terms that would appear in a correctly specified model are missing Under fitting would occur for example when fitting a linear model to non linear data Such a model will tend to have poor predictive performance The possibility of over fitting exists because the criterion used for selecting the model is not the same as the criterion used to judge the suitability of a model For example a model might be selected by maximizing its performance on some set of training data and yet its suitability might be determined by its ability to perform well on unseen data then over fitting occurs when a model begins to memorize training data rather than learning to generalize from a trend As an extreme example if the number of parameters is the same as or greater than the number of observations then a model can perfectly predict the training data simply by memorizing the data in its entirety For an illustration see Figure 2 Such a model though will typically fail severely when making predictions The potential for overfitting depends not only on the number of parameters and data but also the conformability of the model structure with the data shape and the magnitude of model error compared to the expected level of noise or error in the data Even when the fitted model does not have an excessive number of parameters it is to be expected that the fitted relationship will appear to perform less well on a new data set than on the data set used for fitting a phenomenon sometimes known as shrinkage In particular the value of the coefficient of determination will shrink relative to the original data To lessen the chance or amount of overfitting several techniques are available e g model comparison cross validation regularization early stopping pruning Bayesian priors or dropout The basis of some techniques is either 1 to explicitly penalize overly complex models or 2 to test the model s ability to generalize by evaluating its performance on a set of data not used for training which is assumed to approximate the typical unseen data that a model will encounter',\n",

Privacy matters certifications like CIPP are highly requested A recent development in this area is the emergence of Virtual CISOs vCISO also called Fractional CISO These CISOs work on a shared or fractional basis for organizations that may not be large enough to support a full time executive CISO or that may wish to for a variety of reasons have a specialized external executive performing this role vCISOs typically perform similar functions to traditional CISOs and may also function as an interim CISO while a company normally employing a traditional CISO is searching for a replacement Key areas that vCISOs can support an organization include Advising on all forms of cyber risk and plans to address them vCISOs can assess an organization s cybersecurity risks develop strategies to mitigate those risks and implement appropriate cybersecurity measures They can also provide guidance on incident response plans business continuity and disaster recovery planning Board management team and security team coaching vCISOs can work closely with the board of directors management team and security team to provide coaching guidance and expertise on cybersecurity matters This includes helping organizations understand the strategic implications of cybersecurity risks developing cybersecurity policies and procedures and ensuring that cybersecurity best practices are followed Vendor product and service evaluation and selection vCISOs can assist organizations in evaluating and selecting cybersecurity products and services such as firewalls intrusion detection systems and security information and event management SIEM solutions They can also help with contract negotiations and vendor management to ensure that organizations are getting the best value from their cybersecurity investments Maturity modeling operations and engineering team processes capability and skills vCISOs can assess an organization s cybersecurity maturity level and develop plans to improve processes capabilities and skills of operations and engineering teams This includes conducting cybersecurity assessments implementing cybersecurity frameworks and providing training and development programs for staff Board and management team briefings and updates vCISOs can provide regular briefings and updates to the board of directors and management team on the current cybersecurity landscape emerging threats and best practices They can also assist in developing cybersecurity awareness programs and training for employees at all levels of the organization Operating and Capital budget planning and review vCISOs can assist in the planning and review of operating and capital budgets related to cybersecurity This includes identifying and prioritizing cybersecurity investments developing cost effective strategies for cybersecurity and ensuring that adequate resources are allocated to address cybersecurity risks',\n",
